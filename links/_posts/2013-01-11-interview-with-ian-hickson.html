<p>This is a great interview of Hixie by <a href="http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/">Bruce Lawson</a> for HTML5 Doctor with some frank and detailed answers. If you have any interest at all in HTML as a standard and its future, you should read this &mdash; it's good to get more of an insight into what might seem, from the outside, to be arbitrary decision-making. Also worth a read is the prior <a href="http://html5doctor.com/interview-with-robin-berjon-html5-editor/">interview with Robin Berjon</a>, Hixie's opposite number at the W3C.</p>
