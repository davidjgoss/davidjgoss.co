<>I somehow missed this when it was announced, but the second version of Microformats is a significant improvement &mdash; much nicer classnames, less verbosity, and most importantly less markup cruft. (At this point Google's <a href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/richsnippets">Structured Data Testing Tool</a> doesn't recognise the new formats, but that should change soon.)</p>
