<p>Mark Perkins, following up on <a href="https://twitter.com/allmarkedup/status/91600930172190720">his tweet</a> about how content management systems should leave the markup to you "and give you access to the data". Does anyone make a product that just does what Mark is describing? No bloated admin interface, no templates, no themes, no widgets, just a good API with good documentation?</p>
