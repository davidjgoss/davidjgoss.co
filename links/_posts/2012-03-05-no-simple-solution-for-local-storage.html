<p>Christian Heilmann says we ought to "stop advocating <code>localStorage</code>" as it performs badly. Hmm. I like <code>localStorage</code>, and it does work well when used for its intended purpose &mdash; storing little bits of data in the browser. The problem is that misguided developers are trying to use it as a database, but that's not a problem with <code>localStorage</code>, it's a problem with misguided developers.</p>
