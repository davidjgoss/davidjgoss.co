<p>Like many web designers, I am really interested in typography and what can be done with it on the web. Unfortunately, like many web developers, I know almost nothing about typography, so I'm trying to cure my ignorance by reading articles like this one by Trent Walton, discussing type in the context of responsive design.</p>
