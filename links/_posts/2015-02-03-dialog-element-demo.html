<p>Native <code>&lt;dialog&gt;</code> support is now here, albeit only in Chromium so far. This page has some useful code examples and demos, as well as a short FAQ. I spent some of yesterday at work refactoring our modal dialog widget to use the native implementation when available, and it was pretty straightforward, although I look forward to the day when we don't need the fallback.</p>
