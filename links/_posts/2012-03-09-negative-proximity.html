<p>Another brilliant, thoughtful piece on the complexities of CSS by Eric Meyer, this time dealing with descendant selectors having no notion of element proximity, and how that can cause you problems when using things like the negation pseudo-class. Something I hadn't thought of myself, and certainly something to watch out for. With all the advanced selectors, pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements coming to CSS, specificity can become a real nightmare if your CSS isn't well-written and well-managed.</p>
