<p>I love Harry Roberts' CSS Guidelines, so it's great to see them move from a plain Markdown file on GitHub to a beautiful, readable web page, and being further developed (follow <a href="https://twitter.com/cssguidelines">@cssguidelines</a> for updates). It really is essential reading for anyone serious about writing good CSS.</p>
