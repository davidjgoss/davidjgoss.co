<p>This post from Jordan Moore isn't new, but is relevant in the wake of Mobile Safari's "Request Desktop Site" feature coming in iOS 8 (this feature already exists in Chrome on iOS and Android). I'd add an anecdotal observation: users don't just look for the full site link when the mobile site is bad, they do it because they <em>assume</em> the mobile site will be bad, from painful experience. Anyway, it seems like there ought to be a meta tag or something we can add to a page's markup to tell browsers "this <em>is</em> the full site", otherwise users will be pressing this button and having nothing happen.</p>
