<p>I'm off to <a href="http://mobilism.nl">Mobilism</a> in just a few days. One of the bits I'm most looking forward to is the <a href="http://mobilism.nl/2012/programme#mobile-browser-panel">mobile browser panel</a>, featuring people from the RIM, Nokia, Opera and Google mobile browser teams, and moderated by <a href="http://adactio.com/">Jeremy Keith</a>. There'll be an opportunity for the audience to throw some questions at the panel (I certainly intend to) but Jeremy is also asking for questions from people who won't be there to put their hand up. Since there's a guy from Opera there, I can imagine there'll be plenty of prefix-related stuff, but we must try and mix in some other topics as well.</p>
