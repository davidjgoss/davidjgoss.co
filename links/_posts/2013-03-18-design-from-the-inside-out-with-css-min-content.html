<p>Nice explanation of <code>min-content</code>, a CSS <code>width</code> value I wasn't aware of but that looks really useful. It's sort of the opposite of <code>width:auto</code> &mdash; instead of growing as wide as it can within its container, it shrinks as narrow as it can around the width of its contents.</p>
