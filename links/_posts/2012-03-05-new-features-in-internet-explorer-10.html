<p>I've always felt that IE9 generally prioritised CSS3 stuff over HTML5 stuff in order to please web designers; things like <code>border-radius</code> and <code>box-shadow</code> were in, but all the new forms stuff was out. I'm pleased to see that those important new input types and attributes have now been added to IE10, along with many new APIs such as <code>history.pushState</code> plus a ton of other stuff.</p>
