<p>A great idea by Jeremy Keith, to "allow the main element to exist within sectioning content the same as header and footer". My problem with <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> is based on it doing nothing more than what ARIA's <code>role="main"</code> already does, but I would be in favour of this broadened definition.</p>
