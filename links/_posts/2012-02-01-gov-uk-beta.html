<p>I knew there was a new government website in the works that would supplant all the existing ones, but frankly I've paid it no attention until now. Yesterday, though, the team behind the project launched the beta I have linked here. All this is very un-government-like. Clearly there are smart people on this project. In fact, they're running <a href="http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/">a blog</a> about it as well.</p>
