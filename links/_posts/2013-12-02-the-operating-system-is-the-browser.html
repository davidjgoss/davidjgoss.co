<p>This is a nice vision from Anne van Kesteren, but reading it makes me feel a little uneasy. As proponents of the web, we shouldn't be too inward-looking and get absorbed in our own web-focused world. The web and native platforms/apps have different strengths and weaknesses and there will always be a place for both &mdash; there doesn't have to be a winner.</p>
