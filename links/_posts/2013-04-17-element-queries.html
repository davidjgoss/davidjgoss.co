<p>Tab Atkins bring us down to earth with this post detailing why element queries would be so challenging to implement. Personally, I think the ideas about ways to avoid the looping problem won't really satisfy developers &mdash; what we really need is a <code>@container</code> directive and nothing less will do. I'd be interested to hear how implementers feel about the looping problem &mdash; could it be managed with robust error handling or is there just too much risk of crashing the browser?</p>
