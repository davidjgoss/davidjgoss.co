<p>A detailed article from Jeff Atwood about the not-so-simple task of designing and building a login form. Some really good stuff in here, although I disagree about removing the login requirement by authenticating on other platforms &mdash; I'd rather not have my access to online services so tightly coupled to my Google or Twitter account.</p>
