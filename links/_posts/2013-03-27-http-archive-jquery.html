<p>Steve Souders has been through data from his <a href="http://httparchive.org/">HTTP Archive</a> project to find out how many sites use the Google CDN to load the core jQuery library and how that might influence your decision on whether to use the Google CDN or self-host. As usual with Steve's blog, the discussion in the comments is also very informative and insightful.</p>
