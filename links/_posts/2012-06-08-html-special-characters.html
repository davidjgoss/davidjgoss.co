<p>This one-page tool by <a href="http://ikwebdesigner.com/">Neal Chester</a> lists unicode characters with their entity codes for HTML and CSS, along with some advice on implementation and browser behaviours. There are a lot of tools doing this job on the web, but this is the best-categorised, best-designed and most useful one I've seen yet.</p>
