Last night I gave a brief talk at [MK.js](http://www.meetup.com/mkjscript/) about writing elegant async code with ES2015 Promises.

It's a topic that's held my attention since digging into ES2015[^1] late last year. I did a lunch and learn at work on many of the new features, and found Promises both the most interesting (for me and the audience) and the trickiest to cover in a couple of slides, so it seemed to merit its own talk.

I've put my slides up on Speakerdeck, such as they are, and you might want to check out the [example code project](https://github.com/davidjgoss/elegant-async-code) on GitHub as well.

As for the talk itself, I'm pretty happy with how I did --- it was my first try at public speaking --- and the audience seemed to like the content. I should say as well that MK.js is a brilliant little event and [James](https://twitter.com/captain_cow1) does a great job organising and hosting it in his own time with little funding.

[^1]: God, it's hard not to call it ES6 all the time.
