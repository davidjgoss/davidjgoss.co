<p>In just the past day, the world of web rendering engines has changed quite dramatically, with the announcements of both <a href="http://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2013/04/03/mozilla-and-samsung-collaborate-on-next-generation-web-browser-engine/">Servo</a> and <a href="http://blog.chromium.org/2013/04/blink-rendering-engine-for-chromium.html">Blink</a>.</p>
<p>Here's the new look across the four major platforms &mdash; far from a "WebKit monoculture", I'd say.</p>

<p>&#42; May move to Servo<br />
** May move to Servo on Samsung devices<br />
*** Will move to Blink if and when Apple allows 3rd party engines</p>
<p>A few notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Opera's recent move away from Presto was not to WebKit, but to Chromium, so they're moving to Blink as well (<a href="http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/2013/hello-blink/">confirmed by Bruce Lawson</a>).</li>
<li>With Chrome and Opera moving to Blink and Safari being retired, there soon won't be a WebKit browser on Windows (<a href="https://twitter.com/dstorey/status/319588119517200384">pointed out by David Storey</a>).</li>
<li>Blink will not use vendor prefixes, except existing <code>-webkit-</code> ones that will be phased out as their features mature. This is <em>great</em> news.</li>
</ul>
