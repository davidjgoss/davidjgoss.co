I'm David Goss, a 31-year-old British software developer living in Milton Keynes. Currently I work for a software company specialising in auto and asset finance. [Read my full CV](/cv/).

Although like most people who work on the web I'm something of a generalist, at heart I'm a front-end developer --- HTML, CSS and (most of all) JavaScript are what I do. I also take a more-than-casual interest in responsive design, JavaScript tooling and code quality.

I use this personal site to blog (not often enough) about software development and to link to interesting posts from other, smarter people. Other than here, you can find me in all the obvious places --- having opinions on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/davidjgoss), sharing code on [GitHub](http://github.com/davidjgoss), and answering questions on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/2235953/david-goss).

## Colophon ##

I designed this site myself. Its text is set in [Overpass](http://overpassfont.org/), which is free and open source. I used [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) (the SCSS flavour) to write the styles from scratch, except for my [modern reset](https://github.com/davidjgoss/modern-reset). The syntax highlighting in code examples is done with Lea Verou's [Prism](http://prismjs.com/).

The content is written in in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). The site itself is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and served via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). The source is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/davidjgoss/davidjgoss.github.io) and licensed under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
