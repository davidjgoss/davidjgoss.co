I'm David Goss, a full-stack software developer based in the UK. Currently I'm the technical lead of a platform team at a company specialising in auto and asset finance. Day-to-day, I mostly work with the Angular and Spring stacks.

I also work on a few open source projects including Cucumber and Liquibase Linter.

At the moment, I'm really into developer experience, API design, and web components.
